# DesktopCount

DesktopCount is a tiny menu bar application for macOS that shows the index of the currently active desktop (Space).  It relies on the [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) window manager to determine the focused space and updates automatically whenever you switch.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd DesktopCount
./install.sh
```

The script builds the Xcode project using `xcodebuild` and installs `DesktopCount.app` into `~/Applications` by default.  Set the `DEST_DIR` environment variable if you wish to install elsewhere.  Xcode command line tools must be installed.

## Usage

After installation launch **DesktopCount.app** from Finder or Spotlight.  The menu bar icon displays the number of your active desktop and updates whenever you change spaces.

No additional interface is providedâ€”quit the app from its menu bar icon if needed.
